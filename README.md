# Project Proposal
Weet -- by Siddharth Datar 

## Collaboration
Everyone is welcome to join! While I do not know anybody personally, I would like to get to know some classmates interested in making this app. 

## Project Title
Weet -- "We eat"

## What and Why
Allergies and dietary restrictions are now more common than ever. This makes eating at restaurants difficult, which is particularly caustic when going out with friends or family. This can lead to limited relationships, and potentially deadly consequences for those with severe allergies that consume an ingredient they didn't know they were ingesting.  

Weet will allow people with dietary restrictions to find restaurants and food vendors that are safe and tasty for them. This can introduce people, particularly with dietary concerns, to new food establishments. Furthermore, it can inform restaurants how they can adapt their ingredients to people with different restrictions, which can, in turn, increase their sales. 

## Whom will this be useful for
All consumers will benefit from the application, particularly those with allergies or dietary restrictions. Not just that, people who may really prefer certain types of foods can use the platform to search for restaurants known for such specialities. 

Food vendors will also benefit from the application. They will be able to see who searched them but didn't go because of allergies or dietary restrictions. With this information, food vendors can change suppliers and / or add dishes to their menu to be more nutritionally inclusive. As a result, they can adapt to different eating habits, and thus increase sales. 

## How the system will work from an end-user's perspective
For consumers, simplicity is key: just enter the dietary restrictions, allergies (along with severity), favorite foods, and radius you want to go in, and the app will search for restaurants that are safe to eat at and present it to them using a map. Or, they can enter the dish they want, and the map will show them the restaurants that serve it and satisfy their needs. It will do this by scanning the restaurant menu, and checking the ingredients (provided by the restaurant) to verify if there are dishes that aren't safe, or if the entire establishment is unsafe. 

The consumers, depending on the results, can then look at the menu, and see which dishes they like. They can choose that restaurant and potentially book a table. They can also write reviews about particular dishes, as an added functionality to the app. Furthermore, if they are less interested in a restaurant, and more a dish, the app can find restaurants with that dish that satisfy the user's dietary needs. 

For restaurants, they can enter their dishes and their associated ingredients (both bought and in-house). They then can make themselves discoverable through the app. Very importantly, they can receive information about their dishes and if they as an establishment were overlooked by consumers for certain dishes that they couldn't eat. They also will have a portal for booking (if they would like), where they will be notified about the booker and his / her restrictions. 

In case of negligence -- for example if someone gets an allergic reaction -- the app can be used to mitigate the dispute between the restaurant and the consumer. For example, it can see if the correct ingredients were used, if the consumer ordered the wrong item, etc. 

## Scope
There will be significant front-end and back-end load. However, because restaurant menus are online, and most of the features are quite common on many applications today, 4-6 programmers completing the application in one semester is doable. It is the added functionalities that make the application unique that might take some more time, but even then, it is quite minimal.
