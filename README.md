# Project Proposal
Weet -- by Siddharth Datar 

## Collaboration
I do not know anyone in the class; however, I would prefer some time to get to know the classmates so I can form a group with them

## Project Title
Weet 

## What and Why
Allergies and dietary restrictions are now more common than ever. This makes eating at restaurants difficult, but also opens the opportunity for restaurants to adapt their kitchens to meet peoples' needs. Weet will allow people with dietary restrictions to find restaurants and food vendors that are safe for them. This can open up opportunities particularly for people with dietary concerns to new food establishments. Furthermore, it can inform restaurants how they can adapt their ingredients to people with different conditions, which can in turn, increase their sales. 

## Whom will this be useful for
All consumers will benefit from the application, particularly those with allergies or dietary restrictions. Not just that, people who may not have that many restrictions but who really like certain types of foods can use the platform to search for restraunts known for such specialities. 

Food vendors will also benefit from the application. They will be able to see who searched them but didn't go because of allergies or dietary restrictions. With this information, food vendors can change suppliers and / or add dishes to their menu to be more nutritionally inclusive. As a result, they can adapt to different eating habits, and thus increase sales. 

## How the system will work from an end-user's perspective
For consumers, simplicity is key: just enter the dietary restrictions, allergies (along with severity), favorite foods, and radius you want to go in, and the app will search for restaurants that are safe to eat at and present it to them using a map. They can then look at the menu, and see which dishes are safe for them. They can then choose that restaurant and, if possible, book a table. They can also write reviews about particular dishes, as an added functionality to the app.

For restaurants, they can enter their dishes and their associated ingrendients (both bought and in-house). They then can make themselves discoverable through the app. Very importantly, they can receive information about their dishes and if they as an establishment were overlooked by consumers for certain dishes that they couldn't eat. 

## Scope
There will be significant front-end and back-end load. However, beecause most of the features are quite common on many applications today, 4-6 programmers completing the application in one semester is doable. It is the added functionalities that make the application unique that might take some more time, but even then, it is quite minimal.
